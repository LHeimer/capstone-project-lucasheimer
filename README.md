# Capstone Project: Alzheimer's Diagnosis Prediction App
## Rationale
## Description
This app was created to predict the probability of a Alzheimer's Diagnosis using standard biometric and demographic data. The data used for this model was synthetically developed, however many of the assessments and parameters used are common standards used to gauge the onset of Alzheimer's. In addition to producing an overall probability of diagnosis using all provided metrics as inputs, the data was divided into smaller groups to examine the how much each subcategory influences the overall outcome. The breakout of subcategories is outlined in the following table:
|Demographic Information   |Lifestyle Factors    |Family Medical History    |Clinical Measurements   |Cognitive and Functional Assessments   |Symptoms  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|Age| BMI| Alzheimer's| Systolic BP| MMSE| Confusion|
|Gender| Smoking| Cardiovascular Disease| Diastolic BP| Functional Assessment| Disorientation|
|Ethnicity| Weekly Alcohol Consumption| Diabetes| Total Cholesterol| Memory Complaints| Personality Changes|
|Education Level| Weekly Hours of Activity| Depression| LDL Cholesterol| Behavioral Problems| Difficulty Completing Tasks|
|     |  Diet Quality| Head Injury| HDL Cholesterol| ADL| Forgetfulness
|    |   Sleep Quality| Hypertension| Triglycerides Cholesterol|    | |
